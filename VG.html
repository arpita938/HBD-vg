            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">I believe that the purpose of life is to be happy. From the moment of
                birth, every human being wants happiness and does not want suffering. Neither social conditioning nor
                education nor ideology affect this. From the very core of our being, we simply desire contentment. I
                don't know whether the universe, with its countless galaxies, stars and planets, has a deeper meaning or
                not, but at the very least, it is clear that we humans who live on this earth face the task of making a
                happy life for ourselves.Compassion motivates people to go out of their way to help the physical,
                mental, or emotional pains of another and themselves.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Technologies can help make our world fairer, more peaceful, and more
                just. Digital advances can support and accelerate achievement of each of the 17 Sustainable Development
                Goals – from ending extreme poverty to reducing maternal and infant mortality, promoting sustainable
                farming and decent work, and achieving universal literacy. But technologies can also threaten privacy,
                erode security and fuel inequality. They have implications for human rights and human agency. Like
                generations before, we – governments, businesses and individuals – have a choice to make in how we
                harness and manage new technologies.</p>
